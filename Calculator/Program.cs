//1. Printed instructions out for the user
//2. Created a variable called userInput that is going to store the input of the user when Console.ReadLine is called.
//3. I used the string split method in which I intend to split the user's input by the commas they use with should give me the numbers and I'll store them in an array called numbers
//4. Created a variable called output to be set to 0.
//5. I looped over each number(string) in my numbers array. 
//6. I converted the numbers in the array by using the int.Parse method, in which I passed each number.
//7. I created a conditional that checks to see if the output is equal to 0 then the sum is 0. Else if the output is not zero, which it shouldn't be.
//8. Else if the output is going to multiple the numbers that are stored in our sum variable.
//9. I wrote out the printed the numbers to make sure the user input was correct.
//10. Asked the app to print the output and called Console.Readline();
